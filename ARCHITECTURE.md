# ARCHITECTURE

This document explains how the pieces of the Saerens Advertising AI team fit together. In this version everything is documentation, but the structure is designed so a future app (see `ROADMAP.md`) can use it directly.

## The five-layer model

Every request is answered by combining five layers in a fixed order. Think of it as building one complete instruction set before the agent produces anything.

```
1. Global rules        → AGENTS.md            (how every agent must behave)
2. Agent instructions  → agents/<agent>.md    (the specialist's role and output)
3. Client context      → clients/<client>.md  (who the work is for)
4. Workflow            → workflows/<flow>.md  (the process being followed)
5. User request        → the actual ask
                         ─────────────────────
                       = Structured output, formatted with templates/<template>.md
```

This separation is deliberate:

- **An agent is a role *and* a character** (e.g. Setup Specialist "Senne"). It defines what the agent does and who it is, but contains no client data. Its persona shapes *how* it works; it never overrides the client-facing brand voice (see `knowledge/agent-personas.md`).
- **A client file is context** (e.g. a roofing company in Antwerp). The same client is reused across many agents and workflows.
- **A workflow is a process** (e.g. campaign setup). The same workflow can involve several agents.
- **A template is an output shape.** It makes results consistent and comparable over time.
- **The knowledge base is the quality bar.** Standards live in one place and every agent respects them.

## Why separation matters

If client data lived inside agent files, every new client would mean editing every agent. By keeping client context in `clients/`, agent files stay stable and reusable. The same logic applies to workflows, templates, and standards — each concept changes in exactly one place.

## Agency organisation

The team is organised exactly like the agency itself: a small number of **departments**, each with one named **owner** (the department head) and a fixed set of **agents**. This is the single org model — there is no separate "hierarchy" and "leadership" view. AGENTS.md (`## Agency organisation`) is the source of truth; every agent belongs to exactly one department, and every department names one owner.

Departments are ordered (0–5) and describe *who works together and where work flows*, not the prompt-assembly order above:

- **Directie** — the Orchestrator routes every request and owns priorities.
- **Paid Media**, **SEO & Web**, **Content & Creative** — the execution departments that produce the work.
- **Client & Growth** — onboarding, client success, and new business.
- **Quality** — the review gate that checks work before it reaches the client.

Each department declares which departments it **hands off to**; the reverse (*receives from*) is derived automatically, so a handoff is described in only one place. This organisation is **structure and presentation only** — it shapes the docs, the team page, and the system map, but it does **not** change how a run is executed. The Orchestrator still decides routing per request via its own routing table; department heads are not yet activated at runtime.

## The deliverable layer

The five layers produce structured **markdown** — the team's combined work. On top of that, a workflow can declare a **deliverable**: the concrete end product the team's work should be turned into (e.g. a ready-to-paste website build prompt, a Google Ads bulk CSV, a Meta ad image). After the team finishes, the deliverable layer converts the combined markdown into that artifact.

A workflow opts in with a single marker line, an HTML comment so it stays invisible in the rendered doc and creates no graph edges:

```
<!-- deliverable: replit-prompt -->
```

Workflows without a marker keep markdown as their result, exactly as before. The deliverable step is best-effort: if it fails, the team's markdown is still returned.

There is a family of **Replit build-prompt** deliverables — each converts the team's work into one paste-ready prompt for the Replit Agent, grounded in its artifact-type knowledge node, and none of them puts anything live:

- `replit-prompt` — a website / landing page (`workflows/web-build.md`, `knowledge/replit-prompting.md`).
- `slide-deck-prompt` — a presentation / slide deck (`workflows/slide-deck.md`, `knowledge/replit-slide-decks.md`).
- `animated-video-prompt` — a short animated video (`workflows/animated-video.md`, `knowledge/replit-animated-videos.md`).
- `data-app-prompt` — an interactive dashboard / data app (`workflows/data-app.md`, `knowledge/replit-data-apps.md`).

They share one builder (`buildBuildPrompt`) so the rules (no emoji, preserve `[AAN TE VULLEN: …]` placeholders, lose no team decision, never invent data, nothing goes live) stay identical; only the artifact wording, the Replit app type, the knowledge node, and the section skeleton differ per kind. Other deliverables (`google-ads-csv`, `negative-keywords-csv`, `monthly-report-email`) are bulk-import or action artifacts handled the same way.

## Request flow (today)

1. The **Orchestrator** reads the request and decides: which client, which workflow, which specialist, and what is missing.
2. If information is missing, the Orchestrator asks before handing off.
3. The chosen **specialist agent** receives the combined context and follows its workflow.
4. The agent produces output using the matching **template** and the **knowledge** standards.
5. The output is reviewed by a human before it is used in real work.

## Request flow (future, Phase 2+)

A small app will assemble layers 1–5 automatically (an "agent loader" + "prompt builder"), send them to an AI model, and return the formatted output. The documentation in this repo is the configuration that app will read — which is why the structure is kept clean now.

## Execution layer (brain vs. executor)

Today everything is still done by hand. The target split keeps control in one place:

- **The app is the brain and source of truth.** It holds the agents, knowledge, client dossiers and live account data, and it *decides* what should happen.
- **An executor only carries out actions** — pulls data, performs the approved change, and writes the result back. It holds no strategy of its own.
- The intended executor is **n8n, self-hosted**. Its Community Edition is free for commercial use with unlimited runs (only n8n *Cloud* is paid), so cost is not a blocker; an equivalent executor or the built-in scheduler (`pg-boss`, see `ROADMAP.md`) can fill the same role.
- Two safety categories carry over from `ROADMAP.md`: **read-only/reporting** may run end-to-end automatically; **proposing/acting** (anything touching the ad account or the client) always needs human approval before the executor writes.

First automations to target (founder priority): **monthly reports, search-term checks for negative keywords, and ad copy generation.**

Some data sources cannot be reached from the cloud at all. **Screaming Frog SEO Spider** is a licensed *desktop* crawler, so its technical crawl follows the brain-vs-executor split in a semi-automatic shape ("Model B"): the agency runs the crawl on their own machine and pushes the export to the brain, which stores the **latest** crawl per client and reads it during runs (never starting a crawl itself, never inventing numbers). The intake contract and the agent guidance live in `knowledge/screaming-frog-crawl-intake.md`.

### ClickUp as the work-management & approval layer

Axel already runs the agency in ClickUp, so it is the natural surface for *tasks, assignment, statuses, and human approval* — the visible layer on top of the brain. The intent: the app creates a task per deliverable, assigns the responsible agent, posts the generated draft back, and a human moves the task to `Approved`; that approval (delivered via webhook) is what lets the executor act. ClickUp does **not** become a second brain — agent definitions, knowledge, and dossiers stay in this repo.

ClickUp also offers AI teammates ("Super Agents") that can be assigned tasks directly. That is appealing but gated behind a per-seat, all-or-nothing AI add-on, so the recommended default is a hybrid: app-as-brain, ClickUp-as-layer, agents represented by a custom field or a single bot user rather than a paid seat each. The full analysis and the platform/API details live in `knowledge/clickup-platform.md`, `knowledge/clickup-api.md`, `knowledge/clickup-webhooks.md`, and `knowledge/clickup-ai-agents.md`.

## Design rules

- One concept per folder. Do not mix client data into agent files or standards into workflows.
- New agents follow the shared agent file structure (role → character & personality → responsibilities → not responsible for → required input → output format) and get a persona per `knowledge/agent-personas.md`.
- New clients copy `clients/_template.md`.
- New output types get a template before agents are asked to produce them.
- Anything affecting live spend, tracking, or accounts must surface a **Human approval required** step.
